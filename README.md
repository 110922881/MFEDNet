# MFDFNet
## Notice  
We will release the code in the near future; Currently,we provide visualizations of the experimental results and the comparative result figures.
## Overall structure
 MFDFNet is a steel surface defect detection network that centers on multi-scale feature extraction and employs a dual branch fusion strategy.Its architecture is depicted in the figure below.The feature extraction module forms the core of MFDFNet and contains four submodules, designated LGF, MIF, UID, and LCN.
